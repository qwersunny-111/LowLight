# Semantic-Guided-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement

This is the local implementation for the WACV 2022 paper [Semantic-Guided Zero-Shot Learning for Low-Light Image/Video Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00970).

The code execution method is consistent with the [open-source code](https://github.com/ShenZheng2000/Semantic-Guided-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement) in the paper, with additional code for testing the metrics and the test results.
